Player Death.

These are just suggestions as to how you should apply the principles to make a player death feel satisfying to the audience. 

The killer wants to murder a Player:

0. Remember that 'The evil die first'. If the character seems pure and honest, you should 'Tempt the players with sin and vice' more. However - 'Anyone can die' so go nuts. 

1. It should be earned. They should know they are dead before they see the knife. To get this you should 'Play to cliche, or subvert cliche, but be genre savy', 'Constantly raise tension' and 'Give the characters every chance to survive.'

2. It should be grusome. Make sure you 'Give the Audience what they want, blood, death and sex', and continue to 'Play to Cliche, or subvert cliche'. The killer hangs them outside the school gates by their intestines, or drops them on a meat hook and takes them apart with a chainsaw. 

3. Give the Player a new character. Probably a bystander who hears the noise, or an authority figure who was just too late. Whatever - it should 'Constantly raise tension'.

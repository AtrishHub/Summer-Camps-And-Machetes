Trying to escape the situation.

The situation can be whatever you define it as. If a Player is trying to leave a volitle situation, and it is dramatic, call for this roll. 


Examples could be climbing out of the bathroom window to escape the killer, using a lockpick to break out of a prison cell, or even departing from an akward social situation.

# Summer-Camps-And-Machetes
 its a Apocalypse World hack where everyone is playing the teens in a 70s- 90s era slasher movie.   Think small town teens trying to escape their overbearing parents, stuffy teachers and preachy local cops so they can let loose.  Their wild bacchanalian revelry of drinking, Sex and social rivalry is cut short by the blade of the local homicidal maniac.  Its like part tongue in cheek horror splatfest, with a layering of satirising the patriarchal heteronormative morality tales which the game takes its theme from.

Getting rough with another character.

If they are trying to do a violent thing to another individaul, and there is a chance they might fail, call for a 'getting rough' roll.

Taking somthing from them - a literal thing you can take. Like a knife, or a gun. This also counts for grabbing a hand, or a foot. 

Incapacitated means you are physically restraining them, or you have knocked them unconcious. 

Everyone can see how rad you are - You can call how the room reads this situation. Think of it like you did a move to humiliate another character. 

You can escape the situation- explicitly - you dont have to roll, you can just escape the situation.

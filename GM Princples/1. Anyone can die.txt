1. Anyone can die. 

The most important thing to remember is that anyone can die. In fact everyone can die. Not everyone should die. Wit, smarts, bravery and moral purity should save a person, but never be coy about murder. This is a slasher movie, so murder is on the menu. 

NPCs are disposable. Do not consider whether it is realistic, instead, make it dramatic. 

Players are less disposable. They should still die. If a Player dies, it better be a good death. (see player death).

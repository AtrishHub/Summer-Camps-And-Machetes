7. Play to cliche, or subvert cliche, but be genre savy.

If you are with a group who are niave to the genre, then excelent. You can introduce them to it. 

Use the cliche as a backbone. If you are struggling to think of a scene, then just pull a scene from a movie. 

If you are with a group who are well versed in the genre, then even better. Play off that. Give them some of what they want, and then pull the other way. 

Subvert their expectations.

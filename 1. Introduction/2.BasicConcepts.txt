Basic Concepts. 

1. Do what you want to do (don't say the move).

If you want to do somthing, do it. If you can describe it in a way which is consistant with the narrative, it happens. 

The Player dosn't even need to think about 'moves' if they don't want to. 

You are in a conversation. You are telling your part of the story. 

2. Moves 

As your character is going around doing stuff, you will occationally trigger a move. 

Usually this is when somthing stressfull is happening, or you are trying to do somthing you might fail at. 

Each move lists what triggers it, and what dice to roll, and what stats to add to that roll. 

It will also list the results of the move. 


4. Dice

This game uses two d6, thats just the normal 6 sided dice which come with most games. When the game asks you 
to roll, you roll both dice and add the results together. 

A result of less then 6 is usually a fail, a result of 7-9 is usually a pass but with complications and 10+ is 
a complete sucess.

Doomed. 

Certain moves forsake you as 'Doomed'. This indicates that the hunter is specifically seeking
you. If you survive an encounter with the hunter you are no longer doomed. If an NPC becomes doomed, they will die.

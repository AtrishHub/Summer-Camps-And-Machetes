Constantly raise tension, occationally releve tension. 

The cycle of tension and release is a really important part of mastering this genre.

Tension is a question. The answer is unknown but is a source of tension. 

Tension should be thought of as having multiple threads. 

If you release one thread you tighten another. 

This way you can constantly raise tension, and occationally releive tension. 

Example:  

The killer stalks Sean and Jessi across the cabin. They are silent holding there breath. Outside a truck pulls up. 

Tension Threads : 
Priority 1. Will the killer find us? 
Priority 2: Who is in that truck?
Priority 3: Will Jessi finally see i am the man for her?. 

The lights of the truck flash across the cabin, and the killer departs, ducking out of the window.

Release of tension 1. 
Create a new tension to make up for it. 

A knock on the cabin door. Its the truck driver. As you plead with him, jessie spots a human hand hanging from the truck. 
Priority 1. Will Jessi warn sean in time?
Priority 2. What is going on in this town?
Priority 3. Will Sean continue to make his creepy sexual advances
Priority 4. Will the killer strike again?

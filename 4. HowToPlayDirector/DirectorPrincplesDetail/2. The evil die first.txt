The evil die first. 

The slasher movie is at its heart, a morality tale.

Traditionally, the virtues of the slasher movie are purity, virginity, abstonance, pacifism and chastity. 

That means taking drugs, having sex, being provocotive, defying authority, being violent, drunk, rude, selcious or 'a tease' are all things which put a target on your back. 

Kind of a gross aspect of the genre is its views on women, subversives, queers and minorities 'who deserve to die'. 

Despite my discomfort with the subject, this is an explicit part of the genre and it ghost will haunt the game.
